iNARK uses CMake for the creation of the makefiles. it has to be installed if not present version 3.0.2 minimum.


boost libraries are needed. 
to install on linux:
ubuntu-like: libboost-all
opensuse: boost-devel

cmake: 	-DDEBUG:BOOL=ON/OFF if debug prints are required or not
	-DTIME:BOOL=ON/OFF if measurements of the execution time are required
	-DSEM_CHECK:BOOL=ON/OFF if semantical check on the graph have to be performed or not. default not (the input is supposed to be correct, and the program had to be as fast as possible)
